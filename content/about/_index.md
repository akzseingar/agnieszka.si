I like questions - for me, a stupid question doesn't exist. I think honest communication solves everything. Beeing an adult doesn't mean beeing uptight. I believe in timeless design.

My name is Agnieszka, half polish, half slovenian. I was born in 1986 in small and pretty country of Slovenia, where I also live and work as freelancer.

After finishing [Textile and fashion design](/portfolio/paper-artwork/) at University of Ljubljana, I got into graphic design and illustration. I've worked on various projects as a freelance graphic designer. I've made [tactile pictures](/portfolio/tactile/) and prepared 3D models of an archeological site for museums, I've designed [logotypes](/portfolio/star-reach/), [brochures](/portfolio/fri-brochure/), [visual identities](/portfolio/quasar/) for various companies, made [illustrations](/portfolio/codox/) for web sites and [magazine covers](/portfolio/beep/), some [2D animation](/portfolio/orange/#video) and also a [scientific illustration](/portfolio/seeing-unseeable/).

**Clients:** City Museum of Ljubljana, Celje Regional Museum, Faculty of Computer and Information Science Ljubljana, Wlan Slovenija, Synchrotron Soleil, Orange Data mining, Codox, Lund University.

I speak slovenian, english, polish, and croatian fluently. I speak basic french. In my free time I like to do sport climbing, tango dancing (I was a cofounder of a tango school for 1 year), wandering in the nature and deep conversations (not just with myself!).
