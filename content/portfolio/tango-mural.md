Big mural painting for a dance studio.
<!--more-->

I've painted four walls in a dance studio Plac 172 in my hometown Ljubljana. We agreed with the owner of the studio to paint human bodies that are dancing, moving, singing, playing and celebrating the life. The mural had to be simple in shape and color but also good looking. I've made the bodies and the leaves big, keeping the character of the shapes consistent and carefully selecting the color palette. The outcome was very good. The style and position of the mural fits really nicely with in the studio and it adds the place uniqueness.

The process was very straight forward: first I drew the sketches on my iPad, than I used the projector to draw the outlines on the walls. I mixed the 4 basic colours which were used for bodies and leaves and finally painted the shapes.
