Visual identity for a data mining program.
<!--more-->

Quasar is a part of Orange Data Mining family. It is an open source data visualisation program. We wanted to keep the playful style that Orange has and created a new mascot - Quasar, brother of Orange. I've made a new logotype, mascot which also works as icon and funny explanatory illustrations.
