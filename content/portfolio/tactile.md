Tactile paintings.
<!--more-->
A tactile picture is a relief, that blind people can understand with fingertips. It has to be very simple, so the blind people recognize the form while touching it. I've made several tactile paintings from original paintings at City Museum of Ljubljana and Celje Regional Museum. I've also made a 3D tactile model of Archaeological park Emona in Ljubljana.
