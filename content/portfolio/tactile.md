Tactile illustrations.
<!--more-->
A tactile illustration is reliefed illustration that can be understood with fingertips. It has to be very simple, so the blind people recognize the form while touching it. I've done several tactile illustrations for City Museum of Ljubljana and Celje Regional Museum.
